# Embrace making pour decisions!
This Angular frontend application creates a fully interactive interface for the [Java Restful API Backend](https://github.com/Halleywood/PourDecisionsBackEnd), and together they form an interactive wine tasting note application! The frontend leverages a security service to handle the user's JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure access to protected data resources. The AuthGuard ensures that all routes are accessible only to authenticated users.
The user is then greeted by a homepage that displays their profile with custom picture, username, and quirky tagline. Because drinking wine doesn't have to be serious business. From the homepage a user can navigate to the wines section where they can see all wines in the database, or search by their favorite varietal. Clicking on a wine reveals comprehensive details, including user-generated reviews and opinions. It allows users to join the conversation, sharing their own thoughts and engaging with their friends' reviews. With a strong emphasis on user interaction and customization, the application offers a visually appealing and informative wine exploration experience.
Ultimately, my API empowers wine enthusiasts with a seamless and secure platform to share their pour decisions, explore new wines, and connect with those with a grape passion for vino! Cheers to making pour decisions together!

##  Tools and Technologies
* Angular Framework
* TypeScript
* The Angular Command Line Interface
* Node.js and npm
* Angular Material
* RxJS
* Angular Router
* HttpClient
* AuthGuard 

## Hurdles and Wins 
* Implementing the security on the front end
  * This was both a win and a hurdle. There were a few times when I thought I should just scrap this goal in fear I would run out of time, but I was able to set up my Auth service utilizing AuthGuard for protected routes and a JWT Service for grabbing the JWT from the login response and handling it accordingly. I ended up using SessionStorage over LocalStorage to really ensure that the authentication and authorization was indeed happening and it wasn't a bug. 

    * I did have a very hard time trying to parse the login response accordingly...at one point I had made a very complicated custom Regex method to splicing the JWT "string". 
    * And then further into the project I learned about JSON.parse() and I was able to extract the JWT in two lines of code. ðŸ‘¿

    * Here's a win!

 * Issues with JSON Ignore on the backend, not having my data constructed the way I would have liked on the front end. This really stressed to me the importance of creating a clickable prototype to get that user feedback from the beginnning.

* Concurrency Issues: When I was deleting a post, I wanted it to update the View in real time. But I ended up getting this concurrency error where I was deleting the post and then deleting the post again but it had already been deleted.

* Understanding Observables
  * I initially struggled to comprehend the concept of Observables. It took me some time to grasp when to create an Observable and when to subscribe to it. I made the mistake of attempting to use the subscribe() method directly after an httpClient request, without realizing that it should be used within the Service component.
    Additionally, working with higher-level functions provided by Observables proved challenging. These operators offer great power but can also lead to confusion and headaches when not used correctly.
## General Approach


## Resources 
* Angular is a powerful, comprehensive framework that I knew we had only scratched the surface on. We had worked with Spring Security on the backend, and it was important that I try and implement security on the front end as well to full grasp the importance and the complexity of protecting user and resource data. I would like to thank the following sources for filling in more than just a few blanks and really showing me the power of Angular!
